# Evaluation Metrics for Visual Tracking

## Average Overlap (AO)
Average overlap is percentage of IoU (Intersection over Union)

$$ AO = 100 \times  \frac {| S_1 \cap S_2 |} {| S_1 \cup S_2 |} $$

where $S_1$ represents the area of predict object and $S_2$ represents the area of ground truth object \

## Area Under Curve (AUC)
Stand for area under curve, which is the average of the success rates corresponding to the sampled overlap thresholds.The AO is recently proved to be equivalent to the AUC. AUC value is usually used to ranking the trackers in success plot $(S)$. \

## Precision (P)
P is stand for precision score. Usually measured as the distance in pixels between the centers $C^{gt}$ and $C^{tr}$ of the ground truth and the tracker bounding box, respectively.

$$ P =\left\Vert C^{tr} - C^{gt} \right\Vert _2 = \left\Vert \begin{pmatrix} C^{tr}_x \\ 
C^{tr}_y 
\end{pmatrix} - 
\begin{pmatrix} C^{gt}_x \\ 
C^{gt}_y 
\end{pmatrix} \right\Vert _2 = \left\Vert \begin{pmatrix} C^{tr}_x - C^{gt}_x \\ 
C^{tr}_y - C^{gt}_y 
\end{pmatrix} \right\Vert _2 $$

where $\Vert \cdot \Vert _2$ is Euclidean distance

## Normalize Precision (Pnorm)
Normalize the precision over the ground truth bounding box.

$$P_{norm} = \Vert W \left( C^{tr} - C^{gt} \right) \Vert_2$$

$$ W_i = diag \left( BB_{x,i}^{gt}, BB_{y,i}^{gt}\right) = \begin{pmatrix} BB_{x,i}^{gt} & 0 \\ 
0 & BB_{y,i}^{gt} 
\end{pmatrix}$$

then,

$$ P_{norm} = \left\Vert \begin{pmatrix} BB_x^{gt} & 0 \\ 
0 & BB_y^{gt} 
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} C^{tr}_x - C^{gt}_x \\ 
C^{tr}_y - C^{gt}_y 
\end{pmatrix} \right\Vert _2$$

where $W$ is a diagonal covariance matrix whose elements are the standard deviations of the target state parameters. $BB^{gt}$ is ground truth bounding boxes and $BB^{tr}$ is the ones generated by tracker.

The success $S$ is measured as the IoU, by testing whether $S$ is larger than a certain threshold $t_o$ (e.g., $t_o=0.5$).

$$ S = \frac {| BB^{tr} \cap BB^{gt} |} {| BB^{tr} \cup BB^{gt}|} $$
